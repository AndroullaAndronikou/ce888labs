A business is looking at changing their current vehicle fleet and replacing their vehicles with ones used by their competitors. They
are have captured the MPG of some of the cars in both fleets.


In the Lab2 we great 2 Python folders:

□ The first folder is the vehicles.py. In this file first of all we read the data for the vehicles from vehicles.csv and then we create and save histograms and scatterplots. 

The Current Fleet Histogram and the New fleet Histogram and the Scaterplot graphs are shown below:

□ The second folder is the bootstrap_new.py. In that folder we are create an array of samples and we calculate and save the mean of the array.  Then in each iteration we get the data corresponding to that iteration and finally we calculate the mean of the iteration data and store it into an array. Finally we calculate the lower and upper bounds for a 95% CI. 

The bootstrap Confidence graph is shown below:
